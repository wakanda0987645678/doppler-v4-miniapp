## Deployment config

This demo application is currently configured to be ran on Base Sepolia with the default contract addresses provided from the [doppler-v4-sdk](https://github.com/whetstoneresearch/doppler-sdk/tree/main/packages/doppler-v4-sdk). It also comes out of the box with a predefined and hosted [Doppler indexer](https://github.com/whetstoneresearch/doppler-sdk/tree/main/packages/doppler-v3-indexer) to make it as easy as possible to get started.

## Testing

In order to use the demo application to create or swap tokens, you will need a wallet configured on Base Sepolia with testnet ETH. [Here's a list of publicly available faucets](https://docs.base.org/chain/network-faucets).
